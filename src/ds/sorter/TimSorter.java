/**
 * Scenario: "You have been contacted by your librarian friend Sarah who works at a library plagued by mischief makers. 
 * These mischief makers are coming into the library once a week and mixing up all the books so that Sarah has to work 
 * late to fix the mess. This means Sarah gets less sleep than she needs and ends up being grumpy the next day. Sarah 
 * (and her colleagues) wants to know if you know of any approaches (algorithms) that she can use to minimise the amount 
 * of time that she has to spend sorting the library books so that she can try to get a good nightâ€™s sleep."
 * 
 * I recommend using TimSort as the sorting algorithm for sorting the library books.
 * Stable: Relative order of equal elements is preserved. Important for library books, since same author or title should
 * remain its order.
 * Adaptive: If some library books already in order, TimSort can take advantage of the partial order.
 * Efficiency: TimSort is efficient with data that is already in some order, which is similar to the scenario in a library.
 * TimSort is a reliable choice for library books due to its adaptability and performance with real-world data, as well 
 * as its stable sorting properties, which are essential for maintaining the relative order of books with the same attributes. 
 * It should help Sarah and her colleagues minimize the time spent sorting books and get a good night's sleep.
